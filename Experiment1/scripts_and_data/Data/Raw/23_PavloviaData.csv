You will see a word for a couple of seconds with a cross. After this you will see ‘Get ready!' appear. This is your prompt to get ready to type.

You will then see the same word on the screen. This is when you should start to type. Type the word as QUICKLY and ACCURATELY as you can. By this we mean, not so fast that you lose accuracy, but also not so accurate that you type very slowly. Try to find a middle ground between the two.

In this section, your task will be the same as before - that is, to type the word you see on the screen AFTER the typing prompt. However, rather than just seeing the word before typing, you will also see a video of someone typing different words to what you will need to type. 

While you watch the video, imagine yourself typing the word on the screen. Imagine how it would LOOK to see your hands typing the word, as well as how it would FEEL to type it yourself. Think about the muscles moving in your hands and the feel of your fingers pressing the keys. While you watch the video and imagine this, rest your hands on your keyboard but DO NOT type until AFTER you see the typing prompt.

Remember to type as QUICKLY and ACCURATELY as possible

Ask the experimenter any questions now.

You will get one practice trial. Press 'enter/return' when you are ready to start the practice.","This is Section 4.
