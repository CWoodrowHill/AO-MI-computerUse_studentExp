You will see a word for a couple of seconds with a cross. After this you will see ‘Get ready!' appear. This is your prompt to get ready to type.

You will then see the same word on the screen. This is when you should start to type. Type the word as QUICKLY and ACCURATELY as you can. By this we mean, not so fast that you lose accuracy, but also not so accurate that you type very slowly. Try to find a middle ground between the two.
