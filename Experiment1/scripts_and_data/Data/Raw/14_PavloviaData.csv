In this section, your task will be the same as before - that is, to type the word you see on the screen AFTER the typing prompt. However, rather than just seeing the word before typing, you will also see a video of someone typing the same word you will need to type. 

While you watch the video, imagine yourself typing the word on the screen. Imagine how it would LOOK to see your hands typing the word, as well as how it would FEEL to type it yourself. Think about the muscles moving in your hands and the feel of your fingers pressing the keys. While you watch the video and imagine this, rest your hands on your keyboard but DO NOT type until AFTER you see the typing prompt.

Remember to type as QUICKLY and ACCURATELY as possible
