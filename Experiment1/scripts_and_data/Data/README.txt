120BPM_videoSpeedData.csv contains some manually determined data of the inter-key-interval times of the video actor's typing speed. 

Raw - this file contains the untouched data output from Pavlovia where the experiment was hosted, as well as folders holding data from other
      measures administered

Wrangled - once each participant's data has been tidied individually, the tidied data are saved in this folder

Coded - the wrangled data are then manually coded for typing accuracy with two additional columns created (No.Errors and accuracyScore)

Final - once the coded individual data are combined and data exclusions are applied, the final datasets are saved in this folder, with one 
        dataset for each dependent measure
